Breadth-first search (BFS) is and algorithm for traversing or searching tree
or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node 
of a graph. Explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors. Neighborhood nodes are those which are directly adjacent or connected
to the current node.

Input: A graph 'Graph' and a starting vertex root of Graph

Output: traverse the whole graph acccording to the traversal strategy
        and print the order of traversal
